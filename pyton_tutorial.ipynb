    "Python is a high-level programming language that allows you to express very powerful ideas in very few, readable, lines of code. It is one of the [top three most used programming languages](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), competing with classical languages such as Java, C and C++. Besides being a great general-purpose programming language, thanks to a few popular libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib) Python has become a powerful environment for scientific computing."

Besides this document, you should look at the [official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/index.html) for exploring more than what you see here, and clarifying your doubts.\n"

    "You will currently find two different versions of Python available, 2.7 and 3.x (3.7 at the time of writing). This is due to the fact that Python 3.0 introduced many changes to the language that are incompatible with previous versions. That is, code written for Python 2.7 may not work under Python 3.x (and the other way around). For this reason, both versions are currently around. For this course we will use Python 3.7. So, make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. [Here](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html) you find precise installation instructions for your specific operating system.\n",

In the Gurobi documentation you will [read](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.1/quickstart_mac/installing_the_anaconda_py.html#section:Anaconda) that they advise using the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). Anaconda Python is a distribution of Python bundled with several of the most common scientific computing packages. Installing Anaconda Python is not necessary, especially if you have already Python on your machine. It just simplifies a bit the way we include Gurobi in our Python projects, but we can achieve the same results also without Anaconda."
